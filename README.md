# uap-localisation
This is a revised version of the localisation from the "Unique Ascension Perks" Stellaris mod. 

Notable changes I've made for various reasons (Such as: consistency, pre-existing established in-game content or logic, flavor changes and in one case because described effects did not realistically match with the actual results):

[I sorted it from least notably rewritten to almost completely overhauled (excludes those I mostly just spellchecked without really changing anything)] 

"Light of Eternity": While Antimatter as a new resource isn't a problem per se, we already have "Antimatter Reactors" and "Antimatter Missiles" ingame so it doesn't really make sense to introduce it as a completely new resource. I figured it would still make sense if it was more of an availability problem, so I changed it from "discovering an entirely new resource" to "finally finding the means to mass-produce antimatter on a scale that allows us to use it throughout our entire empire and not just for our navy". 

        -This is one of the changes that probably doesn't have a big impact on the experience and idea behind the perk and really only adds some in-game consistency to it.      I could still change it back if you'd want me to.
    
  "Underworld Access": I changed "Fallen Empire Remnants" to "Fallen Empire Renegade" since the "Remnants" part seemed a bit odd. It's pretty much just a shift away from some kind of "Remnants" to an individual or a group of "Renegades" that have deserted the FE for unknown reasons. 
  
        -Mostly just a flavory change, but I can still just undo it if you want.
  
 "Void Expeditions": I changed a few of the events in deep space quite a bit to add some flavor (most notably: pirate event, hostile Fleet event). It doesn't really change that much but you might have had some extended headcanon for them already so I figured it'll be better to include it on this list, just in case.
 
        -This is one of the changes that probably doesn't have a big impact on the experience and idea behind the perk and only adds some flavor to it. I could still change it back if you'd want me to.
 
 
 
"Economical Mastery": I figured that (considering how OP it is) the Trade League policy of EM might just be perfect for the inclusion of an "Economical Ascension", which is why I renamed the final policy into just that and wrote some flavor text for it in the policy desc. I also tweaked some of the other policies a bit, most notably "Wealth Aristocracy" and added a bit of flavor text and changes for consistency there. Probably not that important but you may want to look into it just to be sure.

        -This is one of the changes that probably doesn't have a big impact on the experience and idea behind the perk and only adds some flavor to it. I could still change it back if you'd want me to.

"Center of the Galaxy": I pretty much just made it more clear that you are just artificially enlarging a planet to a ridiculous size here and don't aspire to somehow become the actual Center of the Galaxy as in "Galactic Core". Also edited the AP desc a bit to change the reasoning behind it, but thats mostly it.

        -This is one of the changes that probably doesn't have a big impact on the experience and idea behind the perk and only adds some flavor to it. I could still change it back if you'd want me to.

"Genius Pregnancy": Genius Pregnancy is now named "Reproductive Mastery" and the AP desc is a bit different. That is all there is to it, and it is mostly just because not all Stellaris species reproduce in the same way but I figured changing the AP name is major enough to include it here.

        -This is one of the changes that probably doesn't have a big impact on the experience and idea behind the perk and really only adds some in-game consistency to it. I could still change it back if you'd want me to.


"Private Galactic Market": I mostly just added some flavor and in-game consistency changes but it might be too much for your liking. I also edited the tone of some of the interactions a bit (for example, several traders will refer to the player as the "founder" of this GM branch).

        -This is one of the changes that probably doesn't have a big impact on the experience and idea behind the perk and only adds some flavor to it. I could still change it back if you'd want me to.

"Lost Heritage": While creating Hyperlanes out of basically nowhere isn't a problem per se, the "purposely isolated" plot doesn't really make much sense if you are just creating new Hyperlanes (I am not sure whether you even intended it to sound that way and if you did not I'm sorry) so I changed it to "restoring Hyperlanes that were -potentially on purpose- disconnected from the network. 

        -This is one of the changes that might have a minor impact on the experience and idea behind the perk and adds some minor changes to it. I could change it back if you'd want me to.

Anomalies: While I usually tried to keep them as is and simply add some extra flavor to the text, there were some anomalies I might have rewritten a bit too much for your liking. I'd recommend you to read through them all once and then tell me which ones were changed too much afterwards.

        -This is one of the changes that isn't that impactful- but it may conflict with your own ideas
    
"Main Machine Core": Since Synth (and potentially other non-machine empires) can take the AP too, I changed the AP desc and the menu a bit (Also adjusted it in accordance with the Unity/Influence rework) to fit non-machine empires too. That includes the AP name since it was "Machine" Main Core and I changed it to "Empire Central Core".

        -This is one of the changes that wouldn't take long to undo and isn't that impactful, but may conflict with your own ideas
 
 Note: The following 3 AP's went through quite some changes I'd highly recommend you to read through the new descs and names yourself if you haven't already done so/ are already planning to
 
"Library of Wisdom": While the Library is one of my favorite AP's in your mod, I figured that it might not be a bad idea to change it a bit since several things about the library always seemed a bit odd to me during my playthroughs. As a result I changed the central premise from "You are contacting old leaders of your empire which give you advice from beyond the grave" to "You are accessing a highly sophisticated database that contains information about all major subjects, -which also includes the recorded knowledge of some of your leaders- and a specialized AI uses this data to compile solutions for your empire". And while the way you interact with it mostly stays the same it is still pretty different from the original version. The main problems were that it would -even with Stellaris logic- be impossible to "upload" ancient leaders that have died long ago into the library and that these leaders probably couldn't help with problems of the present even if it were possible, since they would have to understand the countless technological advancements and present issues of your empire first and then try to apply their knowledge to that. The original idea is still pretty good, but I just didn't see a way to logically implement it properly which is why I rewrote it instead.
I could still try to rewrite it in a way that somehow explains these issues if you don't want it changed so much in the PV. 

        -This is one of the changes that would take a while to undo and is quite impactful, but wouldn't be that much of a problem to try and rewrite

"Cortana": Cortana is one of the two AP's I probably overhauled a bit too much. The main problem with Cortana was that she really didn't make any sense if you consider already established in-game content: Machine empires, or even normal empires with the Synthetic personality matrix technology are able to create billions of fully sentient AI that aren't capable of these feats, and even your own Researchers aren't able to do what Cortana does. As far as I understood it, your own researchers are more like "research division leaders" and aren't actaully researching the technologies by themselves like Cortana does and more or less coordinating your labs and stations to work on a single problem (Since research speed is determined by the amount of research you produce or have stored and nothing would be researched if you produced 0 research). I change the premise to "Cortana is a specialized AI that finds researchers and other capacities throughout your empire that aren't doing anything useful and assigns them to do some real research in a newly formed 4th division" instead of the "Cortana does everything on her own" premise. It mostly just changes the way Cortana functions without really changing Cortana itself. I'm not so sure whether you'd appreciate the new AP name which is why I'd recommend you to either choose one of my example names, change it back to the old name or come up with a new one yourself if you'd like to include the reworked Cortana.

        -This is one of the changes that would take a while to undo and is quite impactful. Rewriting it may take a bit, but it's still fine
    
    
"Mental Ascension Path": The Mental Ascension path had been one of UAP's features that I always used, but never really understood. While I understood the basic premise and what the results were supposed to be, it always seemed a bit odd since those results really don't match the actual effects of the AP path. These AP's were the original reason I started this relocalisation (which was just supposed to be a personal overhaul of this path back then), which is why I almost completly rewrote them. While it is still very much a Mental Ascension Path, the premise of it is basically "trying to understand the universe a bit better went a little too far" and everything that comes after it is quite different from the original. I'd recommend you to read through it once ingame (since all parts are scattered through the document in the wrong order) and see whether or not this would be something for you. If not, I'll see what I can do and if we can figure something out.

        -Rewriting the MAP took quite a while and even though I tried to simply spellcheck it at first, I kind of gave up on that after the first few attempts. I can still      offer you a spellcheck-only solution where I just try and correct any general mistakes and consult you whenever a part of it is a bit too odd, but I can't really do much beyond that.
